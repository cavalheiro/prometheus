# Prometheus with Uyuni Service Discovery

This is a fork of Prometheus with the purpose of maintaining Uyuni service discovery.

Long term plan is to make this patch part of upstream Prometheus, once service discovery is decoupled from the Prometheus binary. See https://prometheus.io/blog/2018/07/05/implementing-custom-sd/
